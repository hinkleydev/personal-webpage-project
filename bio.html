      <h1>Bio</h1>
      <p>
        I'm based in the North of England, currently working at Barclays as a technology developer. 
        My main interests outside of coding are cars and crochet, which really do not go together in the slightest, 
        unless you're me and you're trying to crochet a tiny replica of your own car eventually.
      </p>
      <p>
        While I don't have any crochet projects to show you just yet, I will tell you more about Maya, my pride and joy Mini One R56.
      </p>

        Maya is my third car, she's done about 52,000 miles in her lifetime and still looks fresh of the factory line. 
        She's got a 1.6L engine, capable of outputting 98 brake horsepower. 
        While I am tempted to take her to Oulton Park, I don't think my blackbox would like it very much.
